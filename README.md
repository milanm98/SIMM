Modified kelly criterion

i find kelly criterion realy good, but there is a problem with subjective sense, as you must type in your own thinking about chances of winning the bet.

And we all know that we are not objective there. thats why i modified kelly criterion so it doesnt allow any bets that are not objectively observated. 

If bookmaker makes a bet that has 30% to win, and you enter that you think its gonna be 80%, standard kelly criterion will let you place a money on that bet. 

My modified will tell you better not to place money, since you are not very well objective about probabilities of winning.

Bookmakers can make mistakes, but mistake of 50% ? That is unreal.
This modified system will block any bets that are over evaluated.
